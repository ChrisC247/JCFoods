                            <strong>2008</strong>
                            <p>
                                The Francis Street Food Pantry was created on June 18, 2008. It opened in the American Red Cross building located on Francis Street in Vandercook Lake south of Jackson. The space was donated to the pantry by the Red Cross at no cost.
                            </p>
                            <strong>2011</strong>
                            <p>
                                The management of the pantry had been looking for a different location to house the pantry since the beginning due to the space limitations at the Red Cross. In 2011 the search was intensive and around 40 different locations, buildings and agreements were considered. Costs to purchase, build or lease another site were prohibitive. In order more affectively deal with the numbers of clients a 501(C)(3) was created under the name of the Jackson Community Food Pantry. This allowed the purchase property with tax advantages to cut costs, manage financial matters, and improve governance with a Board of Directors structure.<br>

                                A building was located and purchased that accommodates the needed space requirements and is located in the middle of the Partnership Park Neighborhood Association. This allows the pantry to better meet the needs of the Jackson community. The location is more accessible to those with the greatest need. The Francis Street Food Pantry moved from the American Red Cross building to this location on October 19, 2011 and was reconstituted as the Jackson Community Food Pantry.<br>

                                A snapshot of the increase in service from the time period between January 2011 and October 12, 2011 for the Francis Street pantry and between October 19 and November 9 2011 for the new JCFP shows 48.8% increase in the number of households and a 61.5% increase in the average number of people served. Not only are we now serving almost 49 % more households, but there are more people per household.<br>

                                The Jackson Community Food Pantry has made extensive repairs to make the building suitable for use. The pantry has created a fund raising committee to do various events, develop collaborative partnerships with other groups, and to locate and obtain grants to stabilize our financial revenue.<br>
